              The AquaClear Water Management Web site use "cookies" to help you
              personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that

            </p>
            <p>
              One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
              feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the
              Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example,
              if you personalize AquaClear Water Management pages, or register
              with AquaClear Water Management site or services, a cookie helps
              AquaClear Water Management to recall your specific information on
              subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
              personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
              addresses, and so on. When you return to the same AquaClear Water
              Management Web site, the information you previously provided can
              be retrieved, so you can easily use the AquaClear Water Management
              features that you customized.

              your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
