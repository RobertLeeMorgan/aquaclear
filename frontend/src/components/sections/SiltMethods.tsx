            As the material being pumped is always a mixture of silt and water, it’s often necessary 
            to separate the two once removed. This allows the water to drain safely back into the 
            original source (or another approved location), while the silt can be managed or reused.

            Below are a few of the methods we at Aquaclear Water Management commonly use.

                Dewatering bags are used in areas of flat, even ground where there’s space to deploy them. 
                Custom-made to any size up to <strong>5m × 12m</strong>, these bags are filled and left to 
                naturally drain water through their woven geotextile material.

                To maximise efficiency, multiple bags can be used simultaneously — some draining while others fill.

                soil, leaving the silt to dry naturally.
