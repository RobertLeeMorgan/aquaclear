## ⚙️ Setup & Local Development

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aquaclear-platform.git
cd aquaclear-platform
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```
3. Configure environment variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_API_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email
BREVO_CONTACT_RECEIVER=receiver_email
BREVO_SENDER_NAME=your_sender_name
```
(The frontend typically does not require a .env for local dev unless using environment-specific API endpoints.)

4. Run locally (development)
In backend/src/index.ts and backend/src/supabaseClient.ts,
uncomment the dotenv config lines to enable local .env loading.

Then run the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
Run the frontend in another terminal:
```
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
🐳 Run with Docker
To run both frontend and backend with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
⚠️ Keep the dotenv lines commented out in the backend when running with Docker,
as environment variables are passed through the container environment.

## 🧪 Testing
Backend tests
```bash
npm test
```
Frontend tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```
Backend: Centralized Jest + Supertest mocking for API and integration tests

Frontend: Vitest and React Testing Library for UI and interaction tests

📦 Deployment
Deployed on Render using a full CI/CD pipeline.
Each push to the main branch triggers automatic builds and deployments of both frontend and backend Docker containers.
