/services/weed-cutting,8,"Aquaclear handles site sensitivities including endangered plants, historic structures, and listed buildings, with experience in castle moats and SSSI canal stretches."
/services/weed-cutting,9,"Mechanical root and rhizome removal is applied to water lilies and reeds for longer-term control, reducing regrowth compared to annual cutting."
/services/weed-cutting,10,"Algae, or 'blanket weed', is mechanically skimmed from surfaces, and silt pumping helps reduce nutrient levels that fuel blooms."
/services/weed-cutting,11,"Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are removed carefully to protect fish, birds, humans, and other wildlife."
/services/weed-cutting,12,"Bulrush and bur-reed are cut precisely to open waterways while maintaining habitat; rhizome removal is used when growth threatens flow."
/services/weed-cutting,13,"Water lilies are selectively cut to control growth up to 3 meters deep, while leaving areas for environmental balance. Rhizome removal provides longer-term control."
/services/weed-cutting,14,"Invasive species such as Canadian pond weed, Elodea, and floating pennywort are removed to prevent oxygen depletion, blockages, and ecosystem disruption."
/services/weed-cutting,15,"Specific methods: Canadian pond weed and Elodea are cut early to reduce growth; floating pennywort is cut into floating mats, left temporarily for invertebrates, then collected."
/services/weed-cutting,16,"Crassula (New Zealand Pygmyweed/Australian swamp stonecrop) is removed using grab buckets to peel layers off, preventing spread and regrowth."

/resources/weed-identification-guide,0,"Canadian Pond-weed (Elodea Family) is a freshwater herb with much-branched stems up to 3m long. Leaves are dark green and occur in whorls of three on the middle and terminal parts of the stem, becoming more crowded at the ends."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,1,"Nuttal's Water-weed has long slender stems, often freely branched. Leaves are pale green, equally spaced along the stem, typically in whorls of 3, occasionally 4."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,2,"These invasive plants are perennial natives to North America. In the UK, they grow quickly in shallow waters, out-competing native species, causing loss of biodiversity, and choking watercourses. Large quantities can cause oxygen fluctuations, harming fish and invertebrates."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,3,"Both species are listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act in England and Wales. Planting them in the wild is an offense. Experts recommend cutting early in the year to hamper growth, with all cut vegetation removed from the watercourse."

/resources/weed-identification-guide,11,"Algae appears as foam, scum, or mats on or below the surface. Bright green to yellowish in UK waters. Overabundance caused by nutrients, warm water, and still water. Blooms can harm fish and plant life."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,12,"Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) release toxins, threatening wildlife and humans. Non-toxic blooms can still block sunlight, raise pH, and reduce oxygen, disrupting watercourse ecosystems."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,13,"Branched Bur-reed (Sparganium) grows up to 1.5m in shallow waters with green spikes and branched flower stems. Dense rhizomes form mats under water that can obstruct flow."

/resources/weed-identification-guide,18,"Mare’s-tail (Hippuris Vulgaris) has whorled leaves above water 0.5–2.5 cm long, stems up to 60 cm long. Creeping herb found in shallow waters and mudflats, prolific methane emitter, can obstruct water flow."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,19,"Horsetail/Snake Grass (Equisetum sp.) has thin spiky leaves in whorls, jointed green stems. Common in shallow waters and margins; spreads quickly and can hamper growth of other aquatic plants."
/resources/weed-identification-guide,20,"Crassula (New Zealand Pygmyweed) – Succulent aquatic plant forming dense mats on still water. Smothers native vegetation and spreads rapidly. Highly invasive; all growth should be removed."
